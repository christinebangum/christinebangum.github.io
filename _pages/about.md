**Welcome!**

I am a third-year PhD student in Economics at [BI Norwegian Business School](https://www.bi.edu/research/find-department/department-of-economics/), supervised by Professor [Jon Fiva](https://www.jon.fiva.no/). My research interests include intra-party politics, political representation, voting behavior and charitable giving.

I earned my M.A. in Political Science from the University of Oslo in January 2022. I have also worked for the [Norwegian National Election Study](https://www.samfunnsforskning.no/english/projects/aktive/stortingsvalgundersokelsene-2017-og-2021-eng.html). Before academia, I spent most of my time on environmental and climate politics.
